I do not feel like I particularly have anything to say in this journal, which is likely the reason I have not written one in the past several days. Still, a somewhat uplifting note is that, with the manuscript image that is hopefully attached to this journal file, I have caught up on all of the assignments I had missed for this class, which is certainly nice.

Ah, excellent. THe image worked (at least in the preview). I will admit to having completely forgotten how to put an image in here and just looking at what I did from my first journal file. I suppose that is their purpose.

Now, I will be writing a blog post for this class later tonight, and am at a loss for anything else to say here. Toodaloo!
