## Journal: Coronavirus Edition!
At least this class won't be that different should it go online. Getting COVID-19 briefings in four classes in a row (counting this one) is kind of hilarious. I'm waiting to see if we get a full sweep! Come on, History 301!

Yeah, Thoreau, people are going to be willing to redistribute the wealth and virtuous leaders will fix everything. We're nigh infinitely far from that actually happening, and, furthermore, neither of those ideas would actually work. Humans are bloody awful. They're selfish, racist, brutish, xenophobic, narcissistic creatures.

The loud and obnoxious background noise from whatever movie or video is being shown in the adjacent classroom (as is frustratingly typical) summarizes well the overwhelming influx of useless gossip and "information" described by Thoreau in *The Village*. And that is, of course, very much similar to the level of meaningless noise that accompanies our massive developments in information technology since Thoreau's time, most prescient to me regarding the internet.
- Nice to see that I remembered how to italicise in VSC.

Thank you, Andrew Cuomo, for closing all SUNY and CUNY schools. Ha. What a way to end class.
