Two days ago I finally managed to make myself a coherent schedule of when and in what order I would get all of my assignments done, and I have now done the handful of "fluid text" assignments for English 340. Truly, I am unsure how well I will stick with this schedule, especially considering my recent tendency to sleep more than twelve hours each night in order to not have to confront the waking day, but we shall see. Certainly, I am also far from my most productive, which makes such things more difficult. Fortunately, the assignments for this class are not terribly time consuming or miserable, which is certainly positive. Still, not having things done very much weighs heavily upon me, even as ENGL340 is rearranging its schedule and I have no new assignments for the week of 4/21-28 for another class. Truly, the war is entirely mental, though the coronavirus is not known for its great boon to mental health.

Examining multiple versions of a text beside each other was indeed and interesting task, and one I can see myself doing and enjoying in the future. Unfortunately, one cannot fast forward through unpleasant periods in life. Though, I suppose if all moments were happy then they would be instead banal and devoid of meaning. The difficulty is finding a way to make oneself live deliberately, hm? Listlessness is certainly an easy option, and certainly very few choices in life are truly made consciously and aware. We shall see, hm? So it goes.

Shall we end off with a haiku, perhaps? I am not a particularly practiced nor gifted poet, but the distraction amuses:

A single loon sits
On the surface of the lake
Drifting with the waves
