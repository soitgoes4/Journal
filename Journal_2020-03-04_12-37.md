I could use a nap. Being awake from 6:00 am to midnight when I was already stiff and my muscles became tenser and tenser from sitting in uncomfortable chairs throughout the day did not help. I blame Super Tuesday.
Hm, I could do an extra credit blog post. That may or may not be useful grade-wise, but it could be fun. I know I would never get around to doing it, though. Being busy, tired, and drowned in sloth do not a productive combination make.

I do like the version of the github module with a black background due to Visual Studio Code. Thanks, Geneseo internet! Le roi est mort, vive le roi! Truly, the internet is the monarch of the modern day.
Looks that there are 5-7 one-word sentences in *Walden* (oh, goddamnit, how do I use italics again?). "Alas!" occurs twice, as does "Ah!." Once apiece "Ay!" and "Furniture!" appear, as well.
Damn, "Fry." was a proper noun, in this case, someone's name. Oh well.

Oh, and I can't look up how do do italics in VSC because of the lack of internet. Joy.
Excellent. Guessing and vague memories have made italics manifest. Asterisks it is, then.

Shift + Enter runs a line in Python.
