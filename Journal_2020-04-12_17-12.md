Ah, and here we are. I had to do some minor bug fixing in order to push my two prior journal entries to GitHub. I had deleted a few journal files that I had made but not put anything in, deleting them both from my computer and from GitHub. Unfortunately, as I did these two actions separately, git did not recognise that the changes I made to the files on my computer (deleting them, in this case) had already been replicated on GitHub. This prevented me from pushing new journal files, and after giving up on thee problem in frustration before, it is another day and with a clearer head I managed to use "git pull" to synchronise the changes, which then allowed my new journaal files to finally complete being pushed. The thing that made this all most confusing to me is that the new files were already staged and had been a sort of pseudo-pushed to GitHub, not appearing under "git status" sans a note saying that one branch was ahead of the other. 'Twas certainly an irritance.

Now, I've naught else to say, so instead I shall note that I am watching a procession of bufflehead ducks through my glass doors. There is a mourning dove in a nest just outside our kitchen window which almost certainly has eggs, and we are hoping that the pair of common loons that my partner and I have occasionally seen a few houses down on the lake do indeed decide to start a family there, as we suspect they are scouting for. And, of course, I wonder if the cat who has been spending time under the shed once every few days will come back. My partner left them a full (cut up) hot dog to eat last time, which seemed a bit much. Half a turkey hot dog seems much more appropriate an offering.

Anyways, ciao!
