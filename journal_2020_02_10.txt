-GUI- Graphical User Interface- The UI for the entirety of the computer, basically
-Folders are an hierarchy. Yup, knew that one. Starts at the hard drive, then users, then myself as a user, then other, large folders, etcetera. The hierarchy is much easier in my neatly organised OneDrive.
-Directories- Folders without the folder image
-Every file on computer has its own address starting with "/Users/jacob/first/folder/..."
-In Chrome, use "file:///Users..."
-When on web, going on addresses in same manner as to access mine own files in order to access files in the internet using "http://..."
-.docx, .txt, .html, etcetera are properly called extensions
-Markdown- simplified symbolic formatting for plain text
-Markup- language for describung content in a text file, primarily for presenting on the interwebs
-Examples of things I lack a good name for:
    -Pargraph- <p>paragraph</p>
    -Image- <img src+"path/to/file.jpg" />
    -Heading- <h1>Heading 1</h1>
    -Link- <a href="http://geneseo.edu">Geneseo</a>
-CSS- Cascading Style Sheets- language for assigning styling to markup
